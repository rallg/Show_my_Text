# Installation

You may build and install `showmytext' in Linux, or in Termux.
Entire process takes less than one minute, if you already have
the compiler and dependencies.
Since `showmytext' is a GUI program, you need a graphical desktop.

If installing into Termux:
    Executable is placed in $PREFIX/bin
    Desktop is placed in $HOME/.local/share/applications

If installing into Linux: May need 'sudo' permission.
    Executable is placed in /usr/local/bin
    Desktop is placed in /usr/local/share/applications

If you wish to change these locations, the simplest method is to edit variables
'prefix', 'bindir', and 'datadir', near the top of file
'resource/meson.termux' or 'resource/meson.linux'. Use absolute paths.


## Compiler

meson, ninja, and a C compiler (gcc or clang).


## Dependencies

glib
gtk3
libhandy
harfbuzz
fontconfig
freetype2


## Custom Text

The displayed text is in file resource/src/your-text.c.
Edit that file, as needed. You may use multiple languages, utf-8 encoding.
No control characters, no tab, no backslash, no escape codes.
You cannot put straight double quotes in the text, because it is the delimiter.
You may use curly quotes.


## Build and Install

In this directory, run script `./installsmt.sh`

It will detect your system, ask a question, then show further instructions.


## Uninstall

Only two files are installed. It is easy to remove them manually.
Program: showmytext
Desktop: showmytext.desktop
